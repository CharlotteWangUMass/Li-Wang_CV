    <li>
      <p><strong>Java Web Service Development: TickDetector</p></strong>
      <p>• Built a responsive website to help clients recognize four categories ticks with three feeding stages in each specie by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.</p>
      <p>• Integrated Google Maps JavaScript API to show clients’ geological location.</p>
      <p>• Initiated Java servlets to deal with HTTP requests and responses.</p>
      <p>• Adopted algorithms and detection model in my master’s thesis as part of detection tools.</p>
      <p>• Deployed services to Amazon EC2 to deal with 100 queries per second (QPS) using Apache JMeter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>PATENT (application in process): A Robot - Badminton Shuttlecocks Collector</strong></p>
      <p>• Trained a model to detect badminton shuttlecocks on the floor by using TensorFlow. All the hardware was set up with a Raspberry Pi and another two development boards in the Robot. The main development language is Python.</p>
      <p>• Designed an algorithm to help the robot avoid obstacles and efficiently collect shuttlecocks at different locations.</p>
      <p>• Adopted a monocular camera to help the robot measure the distance between camera and object.</p>
      <p>• Developed a mobile application to control the robot connected with smart phones via Bluetooth.</p>
      <p>• Built a website to demonstrate each development stage by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/liwumass/DeepLearning_ComputerVision">Selected Projects in Deep Learning</a></strong></p>
      <p>• Applied Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to do image captioning on Microsoft COCO.</p>
      <p>• Implemented Vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory networks.</p>
      <p>• Visualized the features of a pretrained model on ImageNet and then use this model to implement Style Transfer.</p>
      <p>• Trained and implemented a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce images that seem like a training dataset.</p>
      <p>• Implemented vectorized backpropagation and several update rules to optimize Neural Networks.</p>
      <p>• Implemented Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization for training deep networks.</p>
      <p>• Implemented Dropout to regularize convolutional neural networks (CNN).</p>
      <p>• Implemented image classification pipeline by using k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and SoftMax classifier.</p>
